This is a powerful Node.js library designed to streamline the creation of large volumes
of custom voice command training data. It employs the Voicemaker API to generate audio
files that match specific command criteria, offering a variety of settings such as speed,
volume, pitch, and effects.

## Getting Started
Before you begin, make sure Node.js is installed on your system.

### Prerequisites
1. You need a Voicemaker API key. Obtain it from the [Voicemaker website](https://www.voicemaker.in/).
2. Node.js

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/hubab00ba/command-recognition-dataset-generator
   ```

2. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

### Configuration

1. Open the .env file in the root directory and add your Voicemaker API key.

   ```
   VOICEMAKER_API_KEY=<VOICEMAKER_API_KEY>
   ```

   See the `env.template` file for an example.

2. Configure your custom voice commands in the `settings.ts` file under the 'commands' key.
3. You can also tweak the generation parameters for the commands, such as speed, volume,
   pitch, and effects, from within the `settings.ts` file.

## Usage
All the audio files generated by the library will be saved in the `output/**` directory
of your project (unless you specify other directory in settings.ts).
